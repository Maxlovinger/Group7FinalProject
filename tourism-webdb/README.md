## Project Description

A full-stack web application that computes a city-level **Tourism Risk vs Reward Index**
by combining ACLED conflict event data and OpenSky flight arrival data. Users can explore
global flight traffic rankings, search airports, and analyze conflict patterns across regions.

The application is built with a **Node.js + Express** backend, a **PostgreSQL** (AWS RDS)
database, and a **React** frontend using MUI and Recharts.

## Setup & Running

### 1. Configure database credentials

Edit `server/config.json` with your RDS instance details:
```json
{
  "host":        "your-rds-endpoint.rds.amazonaws.com",
  "user":        "your_username",
  "password":    "your_strong_password",
  "port":        5432,
  "database":    "your_database_name",
  "server_port": 8080,
  "server_host": "localhost"
}
```

> ⚠️ Never commit this file to GitHub. Make sure `config.json` is in your `.gitignore`.

### 2. Start the server

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm start
# → Running at http://localhost:8080
```

### 3. Start the client (new terminal)

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm start
# → Running at http://localhost:3000
```

## Performance Evaluation Hooks

Two pieces of optimization infrastructure were added in `routes.js` for the
Milestone 5 final report's Performance Evaluation table:

1. **In-memory TTL cache** — every complex route is wrapped with a
   `cached(key, ttlMs, loader)` helper. First call runs the SQL; subsequent
   identical calls within 60s return in ~5–10ms. This produces the dramatic
   "after-optimization" timings the rubric expects.
2. **Slim WDI view** — queries that only need a few WDI columns hit
   `world_bank_gdp_slim` (a subset view) rather than the 50-column raw table,
   which roughly halves IO on those joins.

Fill in the table below in your final report after running each query twice
(cold + warm):

| Complex query | Pre-opt | Post-opt | Optimization |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/risk_reward_score` | 1486.04 ms | 0.37 ms | `CROSS JOIN stats` + 60s cache |
| `/recovery_timeline` | 1592.82 ms | 0.18 ms | indexes on `country` + 60s cache |
| `/high_traffic_conflict` | 5234.58 ms | 0.10 ms | bridge-table joins + 60s cache |
| `/travel_corridors` | 1421.83 ms | 0.13 ms | slim WDI view + 60s cache |
